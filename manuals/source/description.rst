Description
***********

Morphorm developed the **Pareto** software to facilitate optimization-based digital design engineering. 
Pareto provides a suite of integrated optimization-based design tools developed to exploit high-performance 
computing. The Pareto software includes tools for finite element analysis (**Analyze**), gradient-based and 
gradient-free optimization (**Optimize**), topology and parametric shape optimization (**Morph**), 
uncertainty quantification and propagation (**Sample**), and more. Morphorm's suite of software tools are 
designed for high-performance calculations and performance portability, enabling optimal use of these 
digital design engineering tools across a variety of computer platforms.

Application
###########

Morphorm facilitates optimization-based digital design engineering on high-performance computing platforms. Engineers can apply Morphorm's technologies to find Pareto optimal designs across combined environments while meeting expected reliability and manufacturability requirements.

Approach
--------
Morphorm is designed to facilitate intercommunication of multiple independent programs at runtime using a Multiple Program, Multiple Data (MPMD) parallel programming model. The MPMD parallel programming model enables multiple independent programs to efficiently share information at runtime without having to rely on read/write operations operating on files on disk. Pareto orchestrate the end-to-end digital design engineering workflow between multiple programs to find Pareto optimal designs that meet multiple design criteria.

High Performance Computing
--------------------------
Pareto is designed for MPMD parallel executions. The MPMD parallel programming model enables Pareto to orchestrate hands-off digital design engineering workflows requiring the execution of multiple parallel programs. In addition, the performance portability of Analyze and Optimize enable optimal runtime performance across a variety of high-performance computing platforms (GPU, MPI, multi-core).
