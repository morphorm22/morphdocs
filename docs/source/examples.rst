Introduction
############

This chapter will introduce users to the optimization-based design capabilities in 
Morphorm through a series of tutorials. Each tutorial covers the steps needed to 
sucessfully run a Morphorm design problem. The tutorials will introduce users to 
topology and shape optimization concepts and how these concepts can be applied 
to solve single- and multi-physics optimization-based design problems.  
Additional tutorials are presented in this chapter to show users how to apply 
Design of Experiment, Surrogate-Based Optimization, Pareto Optimization, 
and many more optimization-based design concepts to their problems, including the 
application of Design Under Uncertainty to produce designs robust to imperfections. 
A key feature of Morphorm is its ability to combine multiple optimization-based 
design methods to build automated end-to-end design workflows. This chapter will 
present several tutorials to show users how to combine multiple Morphorm 
optimization-based design methods to produce automated end-to-end design workflows.

Topology Optimization
#####################

Topology optimization is a mathematical method use to optimize the material layout
given a set of mathematical objectives and constraint functions.
